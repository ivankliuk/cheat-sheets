------------------------------------
A class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. only one potential change in the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)

OCP: Open/closed principle
--------------------------
“software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”

LSP: Liskov substitution principle
----------------------------------
“objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.” See also design by contract.

ISP: Interface segregation principle
------------------------------------
“many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.”

DIP: Dependency inversion principle
-----------------------------------
one should “Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.”
Dependency injection is one method of following this principle.
